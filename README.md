Projects done in college and outside of it
Though it is said that college doesn't teach much, or that it teaches knowledge that can be learnt somewhere else, 
it does provide some simple, yet learning effective, projects.
That is what this repository is for. To guard some of those projects. and show what the skills learnt while 
working on them lead to.
