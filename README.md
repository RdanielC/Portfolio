Projects done in college and outside of it.
Though it is said that college doesn't teach much, or that it teaches knowledge that can be learned somewhere else, 
it does provide some simple, yet learning effective, projects.
That is what this repository is for. To guard some of those projects. and show what the skills learned while 
working on them leads to.
